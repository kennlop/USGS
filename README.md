This website was made to display some of the images taken by USGS (found on unsplash) as well as to practice creating unconventional practices to display images.

The site also features links to the USGS offical website and a personal porfoltio link.

The counter in the bottom right corner follows the index of the images array to display the current index of the displayed image and then resets when the tail is reached.
